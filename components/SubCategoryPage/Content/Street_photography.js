<h2><strong>What is Street Photography?</strong></h2>



<p>Street photography is a broad niche within photography that deals with capturing the essence of humanity through candid photos. Street photography is about viewing the world through the photographer's lens and mind. While street photography does often happen in the street, the word "street photography" is more of a combination of candid portrait photography and action photography. Street photography could imply that it's only photographs of the street or that it only takes place in the street but this is far from the case. It is named "street photography" because the photographer often goes out "into the street," away from the professional studios and setups of strobe lights and flashes, grey cards, and makeup artists. The photographer has to venture out into the wild and capture candid images that convey a story at the same time. There is something freeing about street photography as a photographer. The photographer is not tied down to anything, it's just him/her, their camera, and a story that needs to be told.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Learn Street Photography?</strong></h2>



<p>Learning street photography can be difficult because there are many facets of photography that one should "learn" before diving into street photography. Of course, the best way to learn something is to just do it, but some foundational skillsets the photographer should have include knowledge of their camera, lenses, and composition. As mentioned, street photography can be seen as a blend between candid portrait photography and action photography, so if the street photographer has some experience with posed portrait photography, then it may come easier to them when out on a street photography session. Here are some of the best ways to learn street photography:</p>

<h2><strong>How do You Get Into Street Photography?</strong></h2>



<p>Once you feel like you're ready to take on street photography, it's time to dive headfirst into it. In the beginning, you may feel very nervous, not knowing what to take photos of or not wanting to take photos of strangers due to fear. It's important to remember that your first few or handful of street photography attempts will most likely result in photos that aren't the best. The important thing is that you're doing it and conquering any fear that you have. But leading up to the first street photography attempts can be difficult, so let's touch on some tips to get into it:</p>



<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>



<p>We fear what we do not know. In a street photography session, the photographer may fear how people will judge them, they may fear that they won't get any good photos, or they may fear that they'll never be a good street photographer. The best way to ease these feelings is to educate yourself as best as possible on the subject. Knowing the pitfalls and tips from people who have been in your shoes is the best way to go. Those people are the street photography creators that you can find on this page, as mentioned earlier.</p>



<h3><strong>Don't Give Into Fear</strong></h3>



<p>Once you've set out on a street photography session, you may feel uneasy but it's only normal. We like things that we're good at, and most likely, a beginning street photographer is not that good at street photography yet. When those feelings start to creep in, don't listen to them and just start photographing. Don't worry too much about the outcome, just remember the education and tips you've learned from the creators.</p>



<h3><strong>Network with Other Street Photographers</strong></h3>



<p>Networking with other street photographers is another great way to get started in street photography. If there are local street photographers in your area, then don't be afraid to reach out to them for any local area tips and insights. He/she may give you insights on the best cities to photograph in your area and what times and days are best.</p>



<h3><strong>Stay Consistent</strong></h3>



<p>Staying consistent as a street photographer is crucial. When you stay consistent, you will develop an "eye" for composition and composing a fast-moving scene. You will start to anticipate people's movements and patterns and know where to stand in order to capture the best image. Staying consistent is also important for getting over those nerves we discussed earlier. The more you do something, the more familiar you will get with it.</p>



<h3><strong>Analyze Your Own Photos</strong></h3>



<p>Analyzing your own photos after a street photography session is important for overall growth and improvement as a street photographer. Things to take note of when analyzing your photos include composition techniques and rules, camera settings, and what you like or didn't like about a certain photo. Knowing how to analyze and critique your own photos is important for every niche of photography if you want to improve. Just don't be overly critical of your photos.</p>



<h3><strong>Create a Website</strong></h3>



<p>After you have a few street photography sessions under your belt and some photos you are proud of, you should consider creating a website to serve as a portfolio for your work. If you think about selling photography prints or getting a job as a photographer, then having a website is a must.</p>



<h2><strong>Skills Every Street Photographer Needs</strong></h2>



<p>Before diving into street photography, it's important to understand the skills you need in order to be successful.</p>



<p>1. Composition: Being able to compose a scene quickly and accurately is a skill that can only come with practice over time.</p>



<p>2. Patience: Street photography isn't a passive hobby, so patience is key when waiting for the ideal moment to capture your photo.</p>



<p>3. People Skills: Finally, having strong people skills and knowing how to interact with strangers can help you take more candid photos without ruining the trust of those around you.</p>

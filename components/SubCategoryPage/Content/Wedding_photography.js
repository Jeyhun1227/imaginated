<h2><strong>How to Become a Wedding Photographer?</strong></h2>



<p>So you&apos;ve learned how to become a wedding photographer, but reading and watching content will only get you so far! At some point, you have to go photograph your own wedding based on the skills and knowledge you&apos;ve acquired. After you photograph your first wedding, then you&apos;ve officially become a wedding photographer! But leading up to that point can be intimidating, so let&apos;s touch on all the steps you need to accomplish in order to get to this point. We&apos;ve already touched on one of these which is the educational aspect, so let&apos;s dive into all of them now:</p>



<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>



<p>As mentioned, learning how to become a wedding photographer is the first step toward actually becoming a wedding photographer. Before diving head first into a wedding and potentially having lots of anxiety and nerves because you have no idea what to do, it&apos;s best to first educate yourself on the subject.</p>



<p>In our previous paragraph, we touched on the best ways to learn wedding photography so follow those tips and you should have a good base of photography knowledge.</p>



<h3><strong>Network with Other Wedding Photographers</strong></h3>



<p>Networking with other wedding photographers is also another thing you should be doing after you educate yourself as best as you can on wedding photography. Networking can be intimidating because we often think, &quot;how do I even start networking?&quot; Here&apos;s some advice for networking as a wedding photographer. Find some local wedding photographers in your area and reach out to them via email. Send them a message that you&apos;re looking to get started as a wedding photographer and you would love to take them out to coffee to pick their brain. If you are brand new and don&apos;t mind gaining experience without money, then ask if you could shadow them on a wedding photography session so you can see the ins and outs that go on behind the scenes during a wedding photoshoot. When you shadow another photographer and help them out, then it&apos;s called being a &quot;Second Shooter&quot; so be sure to use that terminology.</p>



<h3><strong>Reach Out to Friends Who Are Engaged</strong></h3>



<p>Once you have the proper knowledge and some on-hands experience during a wedding photography session, it&apos;s time to venture out on your own! The best way to do this is to work with people you already know. This means reaching out to friends or acquaintances who are engaged and asking them if you could photograph their wedding. Be sure to not make your friend feel uncomfortable because they would love to have you photograph their wedding but you also don&apos;t really have much experience. With this being said, the best way to pose the question is to ask them while also showing them the photos you took during your on-hands experience as a &quot;Second Shooter.&quot; This way they can see that you actually have experience photographing weddings. Be sure to show them your best photos and get feedback on the photos beforehand. For example, let&apos;s say your first experience being a &quot;Second Shooter&quot; didn&apos;t go so well, get feedback on the photos you took and see what you can improve. Once you are really proud of the photos you have, then congrats, you now have a small portfolio! Once you book your first wedding session through a friend or acquaintance, then you should have even more photos to add to this portfolio, which leads us to the next point.</p>



<h3><strong>Create a Website</strong></h3>



<p>Websites, you see them everywhere but how do you actually make one? Well, there are many ways to create a website, we recommend checking out our Photography Business creator category and learning from the creators in that subcategory as well as the Wedding Photography subcategory.
